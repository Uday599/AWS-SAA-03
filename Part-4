** AWS Directory Service
	- Family of managed services
	- Connect AWS resources with on-premises AS
	- Standalone directory in the cloud
	- Use existing corporate credentials
	- SSO to any domain-joined EC2 instance
	
	What is Active Directory?
		- On-premises directory service
		- Hierarchical database of users, groups, computers - trees and forests
		- Group Policies
		- LDAP and DNS
		- Kerberos, LDAP and NTLM authentication
		- Highly available

	AWS Managed Microsoft AD
		- AD domain controllers (DCs) running Windows server
		- Reachable by application in your VPC
		- Add DCs for HA and performance
		- Exclusive access to DCs
		- Extend existing AD to on-premises using AD Trust
		- AWS manages
			1. Mutli-AZ deployment
			2. Patch, monitor, recover
			3. Instance rotation
			4. Snapshot and restore
		- Customer manages
			1. Users, Groups and GPOs
			2. Standard AD tools
			3. Scale out DCs
			4. Trusts (resource forest)
			5. Certificate authorities (LDAPS)
			6. Federation
			
		- Simple AD
			1. Standalone managed directory
			2. Basic AD features
			3. Small: <= 500; Large <= 5K users	
			4. Easier to manage EC2
			5. Linux workloads that need LDAP
			6. Does not support trusts (can't join on-premises AD)
		
		- AD Connector
		  1. Directory gateway (proxy) for on-premises AD
			2. Avoid caching information in the cloud
			3. Allow on-premises users to log in to AWS using AD
			4. Join EC2 instances to your existing AD domain
			5. Scale across multiple AD Connectors.	

		- Cloud Directory	
			1. Directory-based store for developers
			2. Multiple hierarchies with hundreds of millions of objects
			3. Use cases: org charts, course catalogs, device registries
			4. Full managed service
			
		- Amazon Cognito User Pools
			1. Managed user directory for SaaS applications
			2. Sign-up and Sign-in for web or mobile
			3. Works with social media identities
		
		Exam Tips:
			AD Compatible:
				- Managed Microsoft AD (a.k.a. Directory Service for Microsoft AD)
				- AD Connector
				- Simple AD
				These allow to logon to Amazon workspaces and QuickSight with your AD credentials
				
			    Exam Question: Logging into workspaces or QuickSight with AD credentials, think about the AD compatible services here.
				
			Not AD Compatible
				- Cloud Directory
				- Cognito User pools
				
				If you are a developer and you don't need AD, you can use Cloud Directory to create directories that organise and manage hierarchical information and 
				Cognito user pools work with mobile and web

** IAM Policies - this lesson cover IAM boundaries and how to IAM evaluates policies

		* Amazon Resource Name (ARN)
			- ARN's are unique and all ARNs begin with arn:partition:service:region:account_id
			- and end with:
				resource
				resource_type/resource
				resource_type/resource/qualifier
				resource_type/resource:qualifier
				resource_type:resource
				resource_type:resource:qualifier
				
			Examples:
					arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/sri <-- :: region is omitted because IAM is global
					arn:aws:s3:::my_awesome_bucket/image.png <-- ::: - no region, no account id needed to identify an object in S3. all objects in S3 are globally unique
					arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:123456789012:table/orders
					arn:aws:ec2:us-east-1:123456789012:instance/* - wildcard. EC2 is a regional service

		* IAM Policies
			- JSON document that defines permissions
			- Identity policy
			- Resource policy
			- No effect until attached to an identity or a resource
			- A policy is a list of statements
			- Each statement matches an AWS API request
			- Statement has Sid, Effect: Allow/Deny, Action is the API and Resource is the action is against.
			- Inline policy is just limited to the role and not available outside that role, typically it's not a best practise to use.

		Exam Tips:
			- Anything not explicitly allowed == implicitly denied
			- Explicit deny > everything else (overrides any other allows)
			- Only attached policies have effect
			- AWS joins all applicable policies. (When we use multiple policies)
			- AWS-managed vs. Customer-managed
		
		Permission Boundaries
			- Used to delegate administration to other users.
			- Prevent privilege escalation or unnecessarily broad permissions
			- Control max permissions an IAM policy can grant
			- Use Cases
				1. Developers creating roles for LAMBDA functions
				2. Application owners creating roles for EC2 instances
				3. Admins creating ad hoc users
				
** AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM)
		
		- AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) allows resource sharing between accounts (individual accounts or AWS organisation)
		- Which AWS resources can I share using RAM (Check AWS for the latest: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/shareable.html)
			1. AWS App Mesh
			2. Amazon Aurora
			3. AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority
			4. AWS CodeBuild
			5. Amazon EC2
			6. EC2 Image Builder
			7. AWS Glue
			8. AWS License Manager
			9. AWS Network Firewall
		 10. AWS Outposts
		 11. AWS Resource Groups
		 12. Amazon Route 53
		 13. Amazon VPC
			
			Example: Create a Resource using account 1 and the account 2 need to accept the resource sharing before they can start using the resource.
			
** AWS Single Sign-On

		- Single Sign-On (SSO) service helps centrally manage access to AWS accounts and business applications.

	* AD and SAML Integration:
	
		- On-premises AD -> AWS SSO (Security Assertion Markup Language - SAML) - lets you access the apps or OU or SAML 2.0 enabled applications.
		  All activity is logged in CloudTrail
		  
		  Exam Tip: If you see SAML in the question, look for SSO in the answers

** Advanced IAM Summary	(Exam Tips)			  
	
	- AD
	- Connect AWS resources with on-premises AD
	- SSO to any domain-joined EC2 instance
	- AWS Managed Microsoft AD
	- AD Trust - Extend existing AD to on-premises AD using AD Trust
	- AWS vs customer responsibility
	- Simple AD (trusts are not supported)
	- You can use AD Connector
	- Cloud Directory (has nothing to do with AD)
	- Cognito user pools (also has nothing to do with AD)
	- AD vs Non-AD Compatible services
	- IAM Policies
		- ARN
		- IAM Policy Structure
		- Effect/Action/Resource
		- Identity vs. resource policies
		- Policy evaluation logic (when we have multiple policies assigned to a role, DENY always overrides the ALLOW)
		- AWS Managed (can't be edited by users) vs. Customer managed policies
		- Permission boundaries (do not deny or allow permission on their own, they defined max permission an identity can have)
	- Resource Access Manager (RAM)
		- Resource Sharing between accounts
		- Individual accounts and AWS Organisations
		- Types of resources you can share (remember not all AWS services are available in resource access manager)
	- SSO
		- Centrally manage access
		Exam Scenarios for SSO:
			- G Suite, Office 365, Salesforce
			- Use existing identities
			- Account-level permissions
			- SAML, If you see SAML in the question, look for SSO in the answers.
