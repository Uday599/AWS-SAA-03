==========================



	** Lambda - Exam Tips
		- Lambda scales out (not up) automatically
		- Lambda is serverless
		- Lambda functions are independent, 1 event = 1 functions
		- Know what services are serverless (Aurora Serverless (Only RDS), DynamoDB, S3, Lambda, API Gateway are serverless. EC2 and RDS are not serverless).
		- Lambda functions can trigger other lambda functions, 1 event can = x functions if functions can trigger other functions.
		- Architectures can get extremely complicated, AWS X-ray allows you to debug what is happening.
		- Lambda can do things globally, you can use it to back up S3 buckets to other S3 buckets etc
		- Know Lambda triggers, RDS can't trigger Lambda (check AWS to confirm) - Important for the Exam

	** Serverless Application Model (SAM)
		- CloudFormation extension optimised for serverless applications
		- New Types: functions, APIs, tables
		- Supports anything that CloudFormation supports
		- Run serverless application locally using docker
		- Package and deploy using CodeDeploy
	
	** Elastic Container Service (ECS) 

		What are Containers and Docker?
			- A container is a package that contains an application, libraries, runtime and tools required to run it
			- Run on a container engine like Docker
			- Provides the isolation benefits of virtualisation with less overhead and faster starts than VMs
			- Containerised applications are portable and offer a consistent environment. Which allocate memory and CPU per container.
		
		What is ECS?
			- Managed container orchestration service.
			- Create clusters to manage fleets of container deployments
			- EC2 manages EC2 or Fargate instances
			- Schedules containers for optimal placement
			- Defines rules for CPU and memory requirements
			- Monitors resource utilisation
			- Deploy, update and roll back
			- Free... for real!, However we pay for the resources that are provisioned.
			- Integrates with VPC, security groups, EBS volumes and ELB
			- CloudTrail and CloudWatch
		
		ECS Components:
			- Cluster: Logical collection of ECS resources - either ECS EC2 instances or Fargate instances
			
			- Task Defintion: Defines your application. Similar to a Dockerfile but for running containers in ECS. Can contain multiple containers.
			
			- Container Definition:	Inside a task defintion, it defines the individual container a task uses. Controls CPU and memory allocation and port mappings.			
			
			- Task: Single running copy of any containers defined by a task definition. One working copy of an application (e.g., DB and web containers)
			
			- Service: Allows tasks definitions to be scaled by adding tasks. Defines minimum and maximum values.
			
			- Registry:	Storage for container images (e.g, Elastic Container Registry (ECR) or Docket Hub). Used to download images to create containers.			
			
		Fargate
			- Serverless container engine
			- Eliminates need to provision and manage servers
			- Works with both ECS and EKS
			- Each workload runs in its own kernel
			- Isolation and security
			- Choose EC2 instead if
				- Compliance requirements
				- Require broader customisation
				- Applications require GPU
		
		EKS
			- Elastic Kubernetes Service
			- K8s is open-source software that lets you deploy and manage containerised applications at scale
			- Same toolset on-premises and in cloud
			- Containers are grouped in pods.		
			- Like ECS, supports both EC2 and Fargate
			- Why use EKS?
				- Already using K8s
				- Want to migrate to AWS
		
		ECR
			- Managed Docker container registry
			- Store, manage and deploy images
			- Integrated with ECS and EKS
			- Works with on-premises deployments
			- Highly available
			- Integrated with IAM
			- Pay for storage and data transfer
		
		ECS + ELB
			- Distribute traffic evenly across tasks in your service
			- Supports ALB, NLB, CLB
			- Use ALB to route HTTP/HTTPS (layer 7) traffic 
			- Use NLB or CLB to route TCP (layer 4) traffic
			- Supported by both EC2 and Fargate launch types.
			- ALB allows:
				- Dynamic host port mapping
				- Path-based routing
				- Priority rules
			- ALB is recommended over NLB or CLB	
		
		ECS Security (Imp for the Exam)
			- Instance Roles vs Task Roles
				- Instance Roles - applies policy to all tasks running on EC2 instance (for ex: S3 access), which is not ideal for security.
				- Task Roles - Applies policies per task (for ex: Role A: S3 only, Role B: S3 + DynamoDB). which is ideal for security.
		
	** Serverless Summary
		 - Traditional vs Serverless Architecture
		 - Go for Serveless Model with API Gateway, Lambda and DynamoDB
		 - Lambda Exam Tips:
		 	- Lambda scales out (not up) dynamically
			- Lambda functions are independent, 1 event = 1 functions
			- Lambda is serverless
			- Know what services are serverless! RDS is not serverless with the exception of Aurora Serverless
			- Lambda functions can trigger other lambda functions, 1 event can = x functions if functions trigger other functions.
			- Architectures can get extremely complicated, AWS X-ray allows you to debug what is happening.
			- Lambda can do things globally, you can use it to back up S3 buckets to other S3 buckets etc.
			- Know your triggers and know what can't be triggered from Lambda.
			- Which of the following services can invoke a Lambda function synchronously?
			  Answer: ALB, Cognito, Lex, Alexa, API Gateway, CloudFront, and Kinesis Data Firehose are all valid direct (synchronous) triggers for Lambda functions. S3 is one of the valid asynchronous triggers.
